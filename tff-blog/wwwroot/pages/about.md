# About

Hi there 👋

I’m Tiago Fonseca, a software engineer from Portugal. I started coding when I was about 15 years old at school. Since then I've mainly worked with .net! From web forms to the latest thing there is at .net stack. Over the past years, I've designed, developed, and deployed various projects using different technologies.

I'm a believer in continuous learning and that there is always something that we can make better.

## Why this blog exists

For more than a decade I had been gathering knowledge about the art of software engineering. 
Although I have mentored others in person and online, I felt I could contribute more to the community by sharing this knowledge in blog posts broadening the audience.

This blog reflects only opinions of my own and is not related to my current or previous employers.
