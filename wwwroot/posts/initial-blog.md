# Why this blog came to be

**TL;DR**

After working for several years in the software engineering industry and benefit of others who write and talk on the web I decided to start producing content myself.
This blog focus on sharing my own experiences and knowledge, I will try to cover a variety of topics related to software development that are or were part of my day-to-day.
Learning is something that I cherish having to document my findings in a clean way for all of you, will also enable me to focus on deeply understanding the explored topics.
As part of my motivation to learn more, I created this blog from scratch instead of using a blogging platform, making this blog my playground.

## Motivation

### Future Me

My main motivation to start this blog is to document my learnings, learnings that I have acquired over the year, and lessons from my most recent experiences.
This allows me to have a place for future me to refresh my memory on things that I might have investigated in the past, since I found likely to face similar struggles again, the blog is a good place to have this information always available.
I also hope that writing a blog in my own words and stating the **"How"** and the **"Why"** I solved a particular problem make it much easier to remember the past problems.

### Share with others

If on one hand, I want to document my learnings for my future self on another I want to document it for others that might have the same problems.
For more than a decade I have been consuming information from other members of the community on blogs, videos, or conferences, starting this blog is a way of giving back to the community.
Although I can mentor and teach others on my day to day having this knowledge shared across the internet allow me to reach many that are not close to me.

## Learning and building as I go

Like I said in the beginning learning is a big motivation, this blog is part of a learning process, what do I expect to learn you may ask?
Let me break it down for you:

### Improve Communication

The ability to communicate is something that independently of what is our role we have to develop independently if we are talking about writing or talking.
Being able to articulate information in a clear and concise manner allows us to easily interact with others.
For a person that works in software development is easy to blur the lines and go technical too fast, although might be valuable to discuss a solution to a given problem right away is normally better to understand the why behind it, the effort to put my toughs into words is a good way to structure the content in a way that what is the problem, how I solve the problem and why I think that is a good approach to tackle a given problem.

### Learning a new technology

Throughout my career, I mainly worked with .net technologies, although the standard for web development is still javascript with the rise of WebAssembly many opportunities were unveiled. One of them is [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) which is a Microsoft web framework for web applications that comes in two flavors, Blazor webassembly is one of the options.
That's why I ruled out the option of using a blogging platform and build this from scratch, also this is a fantastic opportunity to use this as content for the blog.

### Get feedback

Getting feedback from others is always a good thing, the community has a lot to offer, giving insights and sharing knowledge.

## I hope to see you all around!
